Naming conventions:

include files:
- _lib: library without need for a process
- _service: library that needs a service process
- _plugin: plugin definition
- _protocol: structs used in network protocol
- exceptions:
  * gnunet_config.h      --- generated
  * platform.h           --- first included
  * plibc.h              --- external library
  * gnunet_common.h      --- fundamental routines
  * gnunet_directories.h --- generated
  * gettext.h            --- external library


configuration:
- paths (that are substituted in all filenames) are in PATHS (have as few as possible)
- globals for the daemon are in [gnunetd] (for now, have as few as possible!)
- all options for a particular module (src/MODULE) are under [MODULE]
- options for a plugin of a module are under [MODULE-PLUGINNAME]
- options only for debugging / testing / profiling are under [TESTING],
  together with the options for the testing module itself


exported symbols:
- must start with "GNUNET_modulename_" and be defined in "modulename.c"
- exceptions: those defined in gnunet_common.h


private (library-internal) symbols (including structs & macros):
- must NOT start with any prefix
- must not be exported in a way that linkers could use them or
  other libraries might see them via headers; they must be either
  declared/defined in C source files or in headers that are in 
  the respective directory under src/modulename/ and NEVER be
  declared in src/include/.

testcases:
- must be called "test_module-under-test_case-description.c"
- "case-description" maybe omitted if there is only one test


performance tests:
- must be called "perf_module-under-test_case-description.c"
- "case-description" maybe omitted if there is only one performance test
- Must only be run if HAVE_BENCHMARKS is satisfied


src/ directories:
- gnunet-NAME: end-user applications (i.e., gnunet-search, gnunet-arm)
- gnunet-service-NAME: service processes with accessor library (i.e., gnunet-service-arm)
- libgnunetNAME: accessor library (_service.h-header) or standalone library (_lib.h-header)
- gnunet-daemon-NAME: daemon process without accessor library (i.e., gnunet-daemon-hostlist) and no GNUnet management port
- libgnunet_plugin_DIR_NAME: loadable plugins (i.e., libgnunet_plugin_transport_tcp)


Coding style:
- GNU guidelines apply
- declare only one variable per line, so 

  int i;
  int j;

  instead of

  int i,j;


Build-system:

If you have code that is likely not to compile or build rules you might want to not
trigger for most developers, use "if HAVE_EXPERIMENTAL" in your Makefile.am.  Then
it is OK to (temporarily) add non-compiling (or known-to-not-port) code.

If you want to compile all testcases but NOT run them, run configure with the
--enable-test-suppression option.

If you want to run all testcases, including those that take a while, run configure with the
--enable-expensive-testcases option.

If you want to compile and run benchmarks, run configure with the
--enable-benchmarks option.

If you want to obtain code coverage results, run configure with the
--enable-coverage option and run the coverage.sh script in contrib/.
