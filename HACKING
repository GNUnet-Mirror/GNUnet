Naming conventions:

include files:
- _lib: library without need for a process
- _service: library that needs a service process
- _plugin: plugin definition
- _protocol: structs used in network protocol
- exceptions:
  * GNUNET_config.h      --- generated // FIXME: decapitalize
  * platform.h           --- first included
  * plibc.h              --- external library
  * gnunet_common.h      --- fundamental routines
  * gnunet_directories.h --- generated
  * gettext.h            --- external library

configuration:
- paths (that are substituted in all filenames) are in PATHS (have as few as possible)
- globals for the daemon are in [gnunetd] (for now, have as few as possible!)
- all options for a particular module (src/MODULE) are under [MODULE]
- options for a plugin of a module are under [MODULE-PLUGINNAME]
- options only for debugging / testing / profiling are under [TESTING],
  together with the options for the testing module itself



exported symbols:
- must start with "GNUNET_modulename_" and be defined in "modulename.c"
- exceptions: those defined in gnunet_common.h


testcases:
- must be called "test_module-under-test_case-description.c"
- "case-description" maybe omitted if there is only one test


performance tests:
- must be called "perf_module-under-test_case-description.c"
- "case-description" maybe omitted if there is only one performance test



src/ directories:
- gnunet-NAME: end-user applications (i.e., gnunet-search, gnunet-arm)
- gnunet-service-NAME: service processes with accessor library (i.e., gnunet-service-arm)
- libgnunetNAME: accessor library (_service.h-header) or standalone library (_lib.h-header)
- gnunet-daemon-NAME: daemon process without accessor library (i.e., gnunet-daemon-hostlist) and no GNUnet management port
- libgnunet_plugin_DIR_NAME: loadable plugins (i.e., libgnunet_plugin_transport_tcp)



Minimum file-sharing system (in order of dependency):
gnunet-service-arm
gnunet-service-transport
gnunet-service-core
gnunet-daemon-hostlist
gnunet-daemon-topology
gnunet-service-datastore
gnunet-service-statistics
gnunet-service-dv
gnunet-service-dht
gnunet-service-fs (or just lib?)
