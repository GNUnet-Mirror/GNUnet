# ---------------
# Check whether `mkdir -p' is supported, fallback to mkinstalldirs otherwise.
#
# Automake 1.8 used `mkdir -m 0755 -p --' to ensure that directories
# created by `make install' are always world readable, even if the
# installer happens to have an overly restrictive umask (e.g. 077).
# This was a mistake.  There are at least two reasons why we must not
# use `-m 0755':
#   - it causes special bits like SGID to be ignored,
#   - it may be too restrictive (some setups expect 775 directories).
#
# Do not use -m 0755 and let people choose whatever they expect by
# setting umask.
#
# We cannot accept any implementation of `mkdir' that recognizes `-p'.
# Some implementations (such as Solaris 8's) are not thread-safe: if a
# parallel make tries to run `mkdir -p a/b' and `mkdir -p a/c'
# concurrently, both version can detect that a/ is missing, but only
# one can create it and the other will error out.  Consequently we
# restrict ourselves to GNU make (using the --version option ensures
# this.)

  # for two reasons:
  #  1. if the package is installed by a user who cannot write `.'
  #     make install will fail,

  #  so the `.' trick is pointless.
