short notes:

* you are not expected to be able to run this as-is.
* you must keep it GPL3 licensed and NOT license it to GNUnet e.V.,
  for changes add your line to the header.
* does not apply to a guix checkout, you have to search and replace
  the imported modules. in my development of plant, infotropique
  services is equivalent to gnu services (same for packages) and plant
  XYZ is guix XYZ.
* Understanding is optional.
* Patches come as context reading material.
