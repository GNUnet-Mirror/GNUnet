package definitions for GNU Guix
---------------------------------

Usage
-----

Just point Guix towards the root of this source tree:

export GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/packages
or (if you are in the root of the gnunet git repository):
guix package -L contrib/packages/guix/packages -i package-name

The packages in this repository will take precedence over those in the
official distribution.

To make use of the packages in your GuixSD config file:

Be sure to have GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH for your shell exported,
for bash this could be achieved like this:

export GUIX_PACKAGE_PATH="/full/path/to/gnunet/contrib/packages/guix/directory"

In the section of your systems "config.scm", you should find
something like this:

(use-modules (gnu) (gnu system nss))

Now to make use of "gnunetg" as an systemwide installed package we change this
to:

(use-modules (gnu) (gnu system nss)
             (gnunet packages gnunet))

and do the usual thing:
 - save
 - guix system build /etc/config.scm
 - sudo -E guix system reconfigure /etc/config.scm

The "-E" in "sudo -E" is important!
