"Basic bandwidth limitation (YES) means simply that the bandwidth limits "
"specified apply to GNUnet and only to GNUnet.  If set to YES, you simply "
"specify the maximum bandwidth (upstream and downstream) that GNUnet is "
"allowed to use and GNUnet will stick to those limitations.  This is useful "
"if your overall bandwidth is so large that the limit is mostly used to "
"ensure that enough capacity is left for other applications.  Even if you "
"want to dedicate your entire connection to GNUnet you should not set the "
"limits to values higher than what you have since GNUnet uses those limits to "
"determine for example the number of connections to establish (and it would "
"be inefficient if that computation yields a number that is far too high).  \n"
"\n"
"While basic bandwidth limitation is simple and always works, there are some "
"situations where it is not perfect.  Suppose you are running another "
"application which performs a larger download. During that particular time, "
"it would be nice if GNUnet would throttle its bandwidth consumption "
"(automatically) and resume using more bandwidth after the download is "
"complete.  This is obviously advanced magic since GNUnet will have to "
"monitor the behavior of other applications. Another scenario is a monthly "
"cap on bandwidth imposed by your ISP, which you would want to ensure is "
"obeyed.  Here, you may want GNUnet to monitor the traffic from other "
"applications to ensure that the combined long-term traffic is within the pre-"
"set bounds.  Note that you should probably not set the bounds tightly since "
"GNUnet may observe that the bounds are about to be broken but would be "
"unable to stop other applications from continuing to use bandwidth.\n"
"\n"
"If either of these two scenarios applies, set BASICLIMITING to NO. Then set "
"the bandwidth limits to the COMBINED amount of traffic that is acceptable "
"for both GNUnet and other applications.  GNUnet will then immediately "
"throttle bandwidth consumption if the short-term average is above the limit, "
"and it will also try to ensure that the long-term average is below the "
"limit.  Note however that using NO can have the effect of GNUnet (almost) "
"ceasing operations after other applications perform high-volume downloads "
"that are beyond the defined limits.  GNUnet would reduce consumption until "
"the long-term limits are again within bounds.\n"
"\n"
"NO only works on platforms where GNUnet can monitor the amount of traffic "
"that the local host puts out on the network.  This is only implemented for "
"Linux and Win32.  In order for the code to work, GNUnet needs to know the "
"specific network interface that is used for the external connection (after "
"all, the amount of traffic on loopback or on the LAN should never be counted "
"since it is irrelevant)."
