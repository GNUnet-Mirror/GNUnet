Implementable right now (but not necessarily important), with caveats
(unavailable components that will limit what can be implemented right
away), in order in which they will likely be done:
* TESTING-TESTBED [Nate]
* SETUP
* DV [Nate]
* TBENCH
* TRACEKIT
* FRAGMENTATION [Ji Lu]
* HTTP transport
* MySQL / Postgres plugins (datastore, datacache) [Radhika]
* UPNP [Milan]

Urgent items (before announcing ng.gnunet.org):
* topology
  - needs testing
* hostlist
  - test fails (peers don't connect quickly, could be topology issue)

* CORE:
  - soliciting traffic for clients that registered for it is not implemented
    (in the service, client API supports GNUNET_MESSAGE_TYPE_CORE_SOLICIT_TRAFFIC
     but never receives any such messages); how to avoid busy-waiting here
     is a good question (solicit => nothing, when to solicit again???)
* TRANSPORT:
  - crashes:

* FS (basic anonymous FS only)
  - implement FS service (P2P operations)
    + how to send queries (soliciting is not there in core; do we
      also want to do pushing sometimes?)
    + need to bound queueing of replies for other peers    
  - test multi-peer search/download
* new webpage
  - run peer => have a 0.9.x hostlist
  - improve basic documentation (configure, dependencies, what works, etc.)
  - write minimal welcome/introduction to 0.9.x-development/webpage/status
=> Deploy(able) development network


0.9.0pre0:
* UTIL:
  - load: need way to determine network load (up/down)
  - trust: need *fast* way to check/update trust in peers
           (async peerinfo would not be right)
  - OS: existing waitpid call is not nice (not integratable with scheduler! fix this!)
* STATISTICS:
  - synchronous/asynchronous API (& implementation) is not nice
  - does not seem to work with timeouts (especially if service is not running)
* ARM:
  - need to get rid of synchronous API for service starts (cause all kinds of problems)
    [=> eliminate for need to tell ARM about service starts most of the time!]
* Module features to implement:
  - advanced FS API parts
    + namespaces: fundamental namespace API
    + search: SBlocks, KSBlocks, probes, notify FS-service of known results
    + collection
    + location URIs (publish, search, download)
    + persistence support (publish, unindex, search, download)
    + indexing: index-failure-cleanup
    + download: management/bounding of parallel downloads (for recursive dl.)
    + datastore reservation (publishing)
    + gnunet-publish (URI args)
    + gnunet-download (directory)
    + gnunet-search (options, incl. namespace search)
    + gnunet-download (many options)
    + gnunet-directory (man page, options)
    + gnunet-pseudonym (all of it)
    + gnunet-service-fs (remove failing on-demand blocks, many other nitpicks/features/optimizations)
    + datastore: do active migration support here?
  - implement adv. FS testcases 
    + getopt API
    + insert: sblocks, loc uris
    + download: loc uris
    + search: sblocks, skblocks, loc uris
    + namespaces
    + collection
  - implement FS performance tests (needs TESTING)
    + insert
    + download
    + search
    + unindex
  - non-anonymous FS service (needs DHT)
    + basic DHT integration
    + CS-DHT-functions (DHT-put of LOC)
    + P2P-functions (DHT-get)
  - setup (RC-pre0)
    + default generation
    + need to settle basic design; do we want to keep guile?
  - testing (RC-pre0)
    + modify configuration to allow controlling connections for non-local starts
    + testbed creation with topology (needs working F2F topology) [Nate]
    + testbed with churn [Nate]
    + implement library for distributed testing [Nate]
    + implement testcases for distributed testing [Nate]
