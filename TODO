PHASE #1: (Goal: settle key design questions)

ARM:
* Make sure ARM supports daemons (non-service background processes, see hostlist/topology)

Util:
* improve disk API [Nils]
* Windows: use events instead of pipes to signal select()s [Nils]
* only connect() sockets that are ready (select())
  [Nils: I'm not sure what you mean by this; fresh sockets are always
   ready for connect(), just 'write' after connect needs select AFAIK;
   please clarify. --Christian]

TESTCASES WANTED:
For these functions, it would be nice if we had testcases ("make check")
that would cause them to be executed and check that they are working:
* gnunet-service-peerinfo:
  - change_host_trust / flush_trust 
  - remove_garbage / 
  - discard_hosts_helper / cron_clean_data_hosts
* gnunet-service-transport:
  - try_unvalidated_addresses
  - lookup_address_callback
  - lookup_hello_callback
  - plugin_env_lookup_address
  - notify_clients_disconnect
  - list_validated_addresses
  - cleanup_validation
  - disconnect_neighbour
  - handle_set_quota
* plugin_transport_tcp.c:
  - tcp_plugin_cancel
  - tcp_plugin_address_pretty_printer / append_port
  - tcp_plugin_set_receive_quota
  - delayed_done
* transport_api:
  - GNUNET_TRANSPORT_set_qutoa / send_set_quota
  - hello_wait_timeout 
  - transmit_ready
  - transmit_timeout
  - remove_from_any_list / remove_neighbour
  - GNUNET_TRANSPORT_notify_transmit_ready_cancel
* core_api:
  - timeout_request
  - solicit_traffic / copy_and_free
  - GNUNET_CORE_peer_configure / produce_configure_message
* gnunet-service-core:
  - update_window
  - find_client
  - handle_client_request_configure
  - set_key_retry_task
  - align_and_deliver
  - handle_transport_notify_disconnect
* hostlist (everything)
* topology (everything)



PHASE #2: (Goal: recover basic file-sharing functionality)

Datastores:
* implement sqlite-based sqstore/datastore service
  + implement library (talks to service)
  + implement service (datastore + talks to plugin)
  + implement sqlite plugin (talks to DB)
* implement sqlite-based dstore services
  + implement library (talks to service)
  + implement service (talks to plugin)
  + implement sqlite plugin (talks to DB)

Applications:
* implement hostlist service (need to bootstrap!)
* DHT, DV
* FS / fs-libs

Databases:
* have ONE backend working


PHASE #3: (Goal: ready for pre-release) [completion-goal: end of 2009]

* testing
* setup
* gtk, qt GUIs
* tbench
* tracekit
* vpn

Transports:
* UDP backend (need LIBRARY to support (de)fragmentation!)
* HTTP backend
* Testing:
  +  Testcases for set_quota, timeouts, disconnects, transmit_ready_cancel
  + Better coverage of gnunet-service-transport (hello validation)
  + direct test of plugins compliance to plugin API

Databases:
* sqlite, mysql & postgres backend



Minor TODO items:
* UTIL:
  - crypto_hash: use libgcrypt (supports SHA-512 since 2003)
  - container_bloomfilter: improve efficiency (see FIXME)
* SERVER:
  - inefficient memmove
* TRANSPORT:
  - transport_api: support forcing disconnects through low quotas!
    (required for working F2F support!)
  - API: consider having core provide deadline information for each message
    (likely important for DV plugin which wants to loop back!)
  - implement transport API to pretty-print transport address 
    + transport_api extension (API extension!)
    + service-transport extension (protocol extension)
  - add calls to statistics in various places
  - implement gnunet-transport (transport configurator / tester)
  - UPnP-based IP detection
    (Note: build library always, build service when libxml2/etc. are available)
  - instantly filter addresses from *other* peers that 
    are *equal* to our own address + port (i.e., localhost:2086).  We 
    no longer filter those for outgoing (helps with loopback testing
    and keeps the code clean), but we should filter strictly *impossible*
    incoming addresses!  This is for efficiency, not correctness.
  - We currently are happy to take any address told to us in a WELCOME
    to our set of addresses; we should have some minimal threshold-based
    scheme, limiting both the total number of addresses that we accept 
    this way as well as requiring multiple confirmations; also, we
    should possibly try to confirm that the given address works for
    us ourselves (loopback-style) before adding it to the list
    [SECURITY issue]
  - not sure current way of doing ACKs works well-enough 
    with unreliable transports where the ACK maybe lost;
    the "is_new" check would then possibly prevent future
    ACKs to be delivered, all while we're happily 
    receiving messages from that peer!  Worse, the other
    peer won't generate another ACK since it thinks we're
    connected just fine...
    Key questions:
    + How necessary is ACKing in the first place? (alternatives?)
    + Should we transmit ACKs in response to every HELLO? (would that 
      fully address the problem?)
  - latency measurements implemented in the transport
    plugins makes it only work for bi-di transports
    and results in code replication
  - should latency be included in the ReceiveCallback and
    NotifyConnect or passed on request?
* SETUP:
  - auto-generate "defaults.conf" using gnunet-setup from "config.scm"
  - integrate all options into "config.scm"
  - change config-file writing to exclude options set to default values
* ARM:
  - implement exponential back-off for service restarts
  - better tracking of which config changes actually need to cause process restarts by ARM.
  - have way to specify dependencies between services (to manage ARM restarts better)
* PEERINFO:
  - have gnunet-peerinfo print actual host addresses again
  - add option to gnunet-peerinfo to modify trust value
* POSTGRES-DB:
  - finish postgres implementation; simplify other SQLs using new stats
* HTTPS transport
  - PolariSSL for MHD?
  - https integration
* GAP improvements:
  - active reply route caching design & implementation of service,
    gap extension!
* HOSTLIST:
  - implement advertising of hostlist URL
  - implement learning of hostlist URLs



=> PRE-RELEASE

PHASE #4: [completion-goal: mid 2010]
* Documentation
* new webpage




Stuff to remember:
* Features eliminated from util:
  - threading (goal: good riddance!)
  - complex logging features [ectx-passing, target-kinds] (goal: good riddance!)
  - complex configuration features [defaults, notifications] (goal: good riddance!)
  - network traffic monitors (goal: eliminate)
  - IPC semaphores (goal: d-bus? / eliminate?)
  - second timers
  - DNS lookup (goal: have async service; issue: still need synchronous resolution in places, current code may not be portable)
  => code shrunk from 61 files to 34, 22k LOC to 15k LOC, 470k to 330k (with symbols)
* New features in util:
  - scheduler
  - service and program boot-strap code
* Major changes in util:
  - more expressive server (replaces selector)
* Open questions: 
  - how to integrate scheduler with GTK event loop!



Test coverage:
* UTIL: 75%, 4914 out of 6463
