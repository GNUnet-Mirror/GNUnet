0.9.0:
* Transport:
  - When receiving SESSION_CONNECT: actually consider switching session /
    (test this!)
* big code review
* Determine RC bugs and fix those (release should have no known real bugs)

0.9.1:
* TRANSPORT: [MW]
  - 'TransmitFunction' requires plugins to have "unbounded" queue (or at least 
    queue of size > 2), might be better to have at MOST one message pending
    per plugin/target and only send the next one after the continuation was
    called (or use 'notify_transmit_ready-style API?)
  - WLAN transport backend (code cleanup) [MW]
  - need to periodically probe latency/transport cost changes & possibly switch transport 
    (working ATS)
* DV: 
  - proper bandwidth allocation
  - performance tests
* PEERINFO:	
  - merge multiple HELLOs of the same peer in the transmission queue
    (theoretically reduces overhead; bounds message queue size)
  - merge multiple iteration requests over "all" peers in the queue
    (theoretically reduces overhead; bounds messgae queue size)
* STATISTICS:
  - should use BIO instead of mmap
* FS: [CG]
  - implement multi-peer FS performance tests + gauger them!
    + insert
    + download
    + search
* GNUNET-GTK: [CG]
  - add tool bar
  - add progress dialog for 'add_dir_at_iter' scan (can take a while...)
  - NS list in search dialog should use colors to offset our own namespaces from the others
  - right-clicking on NS list in search dialog should open menu that allows 
    * viewing full meta data 
    * deletion of namespace info
  - implement unindex operation (use dialog with all indexed files for selection)
  - finish publish dialog details:
    + normalize keywords (edit subdialog)
  - implement download by URI dialog; figure out where to display those downloads!
  - add combo box to select desired mime type for search
  - provide context menus to allow aborts of downloads/uploads
  - provide way to handle errors (search, download, publish errors)

0.9.2:
* PEERINFO: [NN]
  - expire 'ancient' HELLOs (those without valid addresses AND that 
    we have not 'used' (for their public keys) in a while; need a way
    to track actual 'use')
  - make sue we also trigger notifications whenever HELLOs expire
* WLAN:
  - nice signal strength adjustment [MW]
  - energy cost in ATS [MW]
* PEERINFO: [NN]
  - complete peerinfo GUI (=> start from gnunet-gtk by button!)
  - extend peer dialog with green-yellow-red connectivity status lights
  - extend peer dialog with country flags and names

0.9.3:
* VPN 
  - "DNS" .gnunet [MW]
* MESH:
  - optimized routes (beyond DHT/DV)
