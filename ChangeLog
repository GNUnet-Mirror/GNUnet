Wed Oct 23 00:00:00 UTC 2019
  Remove setuid helpers. They never worked as intended. The
  fixed version is not portable and the defacto good way to
  handle this which is most portable is to let package managers
  handle this (as they do right now, the good ones), and let
  people handle this who read the documentation.
  This commit removes what would be patched out by the majority
  of package managers, which is setuid handling in Makefiles.
  It is very likely that no one will notice this code is gone.
