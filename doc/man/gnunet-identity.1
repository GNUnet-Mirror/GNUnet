.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool for managing egos.
An ego is the persona that controls a namespace.
It is identical to a public-private ECC key pair.
.Pp
gnunet-identity can be used to list all of the egos that were
created locally, to create new egos, and to delete
existing egos (the namespace will continue to exist, but it will
be impossible to add additional data to it).
.Pp
Creating a new ego requires using the
.Fl C
option together with an identifier (name) that is to be used for
the new ego.
This identifier is only used locally for this peer and not shared
with other peers.
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl C Ar NAME | Fl \-create= Ns Ar NAME
Creates a new ego with the given
.Ar NAME .
.It Fl D Ar NAME | Fl \-delete= Ns Ar NAME
Delete the ego with the given
.Ar NAME .
.It Fl d | \-display
Display all of our egos.
.It Fl e Ar NAME | Fl \-ego= Ns Ar NAME
Perform "set" operation with the respective ego or restrict "display"
operation to the respective ego.
.It Fl h | \-help
Print the help page.
.It Fl m | \-monitor
Run in monitor mode, listing all ouf our egos until CTRL-C is pressed.
Each ego is listed together with a unique pointer value; if
egos are renamed, that pointer value remains the same,
if egos are deleted, they are listed one more time with a name of "<null>".
.It Fl p | \-private-keys
Print the private keys (in Crockford Base32 encoding), and not just the public keys.
.It Fl q | \-quiet
Be quiet, in particular outputs only the public key when listing egos.
.It Fl s Ar SUBSYSTEM | Fl \-set= Ns Ar SUBSYSTEM
Perform "set" operation for the specified
.Ar SUBSYSTEM
with the respective ego.
Needs to be used together with option
.Fl e .
After this, the given SUBSYSTEM will use the ego with the specified NAME.
This will fail if
.Ar NAME
does not yet exist.
.It Fl V | \-verbose
Be verbose, in particular outputs the public key of freshly created egos.
