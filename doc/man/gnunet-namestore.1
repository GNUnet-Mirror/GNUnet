.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgnunet\-namestore\fP can be used to manipulate records in a GNS zone.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-a, \-\-add"
Desired operation is adding a record
.B
.IP "\-c FILENAME,  \-\-config=FILENAME"
Use the configuration file FILENAME.
.B
.IP "\-d, \-\-delete"
Desired operation is deleting records under the given name that match
the specified type (\-t) and value (\-V).  If type or value are not
specified, it means that all types (or values) should be assumed to
match (and possibly multiple or all values under the given label will
be deleted).  Specifying a label (\-n) is mandatory.  Note that
matching by expiration time or flags is (currently) not supported.
.B
.IP "\-D, \-\-display"
Desired operation is listing of matching records
.B
.IP "\-e TIME, \-\-expiration=TIME"
Specifies expiration time of record to add; format is relative time,
i.e "1 h" or "7 d 30 m".  Supported units are "ms", "s", "min" or
"minutes", "h" (hours), "d" (days) and "a" (years).
.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Print short help on options.
.B
.IP "\-i NICKNAME, \-\-nick=NICKNAME"
Set the desired NICKNAME for the zone. The nickname will be included
in all (public) records and used as the suggested name for this zone.
.B
.IP "\-L LOGLEVEL, \-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL"
Use LOGLEVEL for logging.  Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and
ERROR.
.B
.IP "\-m, \-\-monitor"
Monitor changes to the zone on an ongoing basis (in contrast to \-D,
which merely displays the current records)
.B
.IP "\-n NAME, \-\-name=NAME"
Label or name of the record to add/delete/display
.B
.IP "\-p, \-\-public"
Create a record that is public (shared with other users that know the
label)
.B
.IP "\-r PKEY, \-\-reverse=PKEY"
Determine our GNS name for the given public key (reverse lookup of the
PKEY) in the given zone.
.B
.IP "\-s, \-\-shadow"
Create a record that is a shadow record.  Shadow records are only used
once all other records of the same type under the same label have
expired.

.IP "\-t TYPE, \-\-type=TYPE"
Type of the record to add/delete/display (i.e. "A", "AAAA", "NS",
"PKEY", "MX" etc.)
.B
.IP "\-u URI, \-\-uri=URI"
Add PKEY record from gnunet://gns/-URI to our zone; the record type is
always PKEY, if no expiration is given FOREVER is used
.B
.IP "\-v, \-\-version"
Print GNUnet version number.
.B
.IP "\-V VALUE, \-\-value=VALUE"
Value to store or remove from the GNS zone.  Specific format depends
on the record type.  A records expect a dotted decimal IPv4 address,
AAAA records an IPv6 address, PKEY a public key in GNUnet's printable
format, and CNAME and NS records should be a domain name.
.B
.IP "\-z EGO, \-\-zone=EGO"
Specifies the name of the ego controlling the private key for the zone
