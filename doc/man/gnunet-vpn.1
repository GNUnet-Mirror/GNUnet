.SH NAME
gnunet\-vpn \- manually setup a GNUnet VPN tunnel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-vpn
.RI [ options ]
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgnunet\-vpn\fP can be used to manually setup a VPN tunnel via the
GNUnet network.
There are two main types of tunnels.
Tunnels to an exit node which routes the traffic to the global
Internet, and tunnels to a node that runs a service only within
GNUnet.
Depending on the type of tunnel, gnunet\-vpn takes different options.
The "\-i" option is required for tunnels to an exit node, whereas the
"\-p" and "\-s" options in conjunction with either "\-u" or "\-t" are
required for tunnels to services.
For exit tunnels, both UDP and TCP traffic will be redirected.
For service tunnels, either UDP ("\-u") or TCP ("\-t") traffic will
be redirected.
The tool will display the IP address for this end of the tunnel.
The address can be displayed as soon as it has been allocated, or only
after ("\-a") the tunnel has been created.
.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-4, \-\-ipv4"
Desired IP address on this end of the tunnel should be an IPv4 address.
.B
.IP "\-6, \-\-ipv6"
Desired IP address on this end of the tunnel should be an IPv6 address.
.B
.IP "\-c FILENAME,  \-\-config=FILENAME"
Use the configuration file FILENAME.
.B
.IP "\-d TIME, \-\-duration TIME"
The mapping should be established for TIME.

Default is 5 minutes.
.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Print short help on options.
.B
.IP "\-i IP, \-\-ip IP"
Tunnel should be to an exit node and connect to the given IPv4 or IPv6
IP address.
Note that you can specify an IPv6 address as the target here, even in
combination with "\-4" (4to6) and similarly you can specify an IPv4
address in combination with "\-6" (6to4).
.B
.IP "\-L LOGLEVEL, \-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL"
