.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a tool to access various functions of GNUnet's transport subsystem
from the command-line.
Most of these are not expected to be useful for end-users.
gnunet-transport can be used to evaluate the performance of
the transports, force a peer to connect to another peer (if possible).
Other functions should be added in the near future.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b | -benchmark
Measure how fast we are receiving data (from all connections).
On exit, the data rate will be reported.
Runs until aborted with CTRL-C.
.It Fl c Ar FILENAME | Fl -config= Ns Ar FILENAME
configuration file to use
.It Fl D | -disconnect
Force disconnection from a peer (used in conjunction with
.Fl p Ns ).
Note that you can use the gnunet-ats command-line tool to suggest connects.
.It Fl e | -events
Provide information about all connect and disconnect events (continuously).
.It Fl h | -help
Print the help page.
.It Fl i | -information
Print information about our current connections (once).
.It Fl L Ar LOGLEVEL | Fl -loglevel= Ns Ar LOGLEVEL
Change the loglevel.
Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.
.It Fl l Ar LOGFILE | Fl -logfile= Ns Ar LOGFILE
Configure logging to write logs to LOGFILE.
.It Fl m | -monitor
Print information about our current connections (continuously).
.It Fl p Ar PEER | Fl -peer= Ns Ar PEER
The peer identity to connect to or monitor.
.It Fl P | -plugins
Monitor session state of transport plugins.
.It Fl s | -send
Transmit (dummy) traffic as quickly as possible to the peer specified with the
.Fl p
option.
The rate will still be limited by the quota(s) determined by
the peers (ATS subsystem).
Will run until CTRL-C is pressed or until the connection
to the other peer is disrupted.
.It Fl v | -version
Print out the version number.
.It Fl V | -verbose
