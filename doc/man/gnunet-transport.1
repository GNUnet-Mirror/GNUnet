.SH NAME
gnunet\-transport \- measure and control the transport subsystem

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-transport
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

gnunet\-transport is a tool to access various functions of GNUnet's
transport subsystem from the command\-line.  Most of these are not
expected to be useful for end-users.  gnunet\-transport can be used to
evaluate the performance of the transports, force a peer to connect to
another peer (if possible).  Other functions should be added in the
near future.

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-benchmark\fR
measure how fast we are receiving data (from all connections).  On
exit, the data rate will be reported.  Runs until aborted with CTRL-C.
.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-disconnect\fR
force disconnection from a peer (used in conjunction with \-p).
Note that you can use the gnunet\-ats command\-line tool to suggest connects.
.TP
\fB\-c \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config=FILENAME\fR
configuration file to use
.TP
\fB\-e \fB\-\-events\fR
provide information about all connect and disconnect events (continuously)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print help page
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-information\fR
print information about our current connections (once)
.TP
\fB\-L \fILOGLEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL\fR
Change the loglevel.  Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.
.TP
\fB\-l \fILOGFILE\fR, \fB\-\-logfile=LOGFILE\fR
configure logging to write logs to LOGFILE
.TP
\fB\-m\fR, \fB\-\-monitor\fR
print information about our current connections (continuously)
.TP
\fB\-p \fIPEER\fR, \fB\-\-peer=PEER\fR
the peer identity to connect to or monitor
.TP
\fB\-P, \fB\-\-plugins\fR
monitor session state of transport plugins
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-send\fR
transmit (dummy) traffic as quickly as possible to the peer specified
with the \-p option.  The rate will still be limited by the quota(s)
determined by the peers (ATS subsystem).  Will run until CTRL\-C is
pressed or until the connection to the other peer is disrupted.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version number
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
be verbose
