.SH NAME
gnunet\-transport \- measure and control the transport subsystem

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-transport
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP

gnunet\-transport is a tool to access various functions of GNUnet's transport subsystem from the command\-line.  Most of these are not expected to be useful for end-users.  gnunet\-transport can be used to evaluate the performance of the transports, force a peer to connect to another peer (if possible).  Other functions should be added in the near future.  

.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-benchmark\fR
measure how fast we are receiving data (from all connections).  On exit, the data rate will be reported.  Runs until aborted with CTRL-C.
.TP
\fB\-c \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config=FILENAME\fR
configuration file to use
.TP
\fB\-C \fIPEER\fR, \fB\-\-connect=PEER\fR
peer to connect to (and to use for sending if used in conjunction with \-s)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print help page
.TP
\fB\-L \fILOGLEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL\fR
Change the loglevel.  Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-send\fR
transmit (dummy) traffic as quickly as possible to the peer specified with the \-C option.  The rate will still be limited by the quota(s) determined by the peers (ATS subsystem).  Will run until CTRL\-C is pressed or until the connection to the other peer is disrupted.
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version number
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
be verbose
