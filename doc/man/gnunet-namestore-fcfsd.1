.TH GNUNET\-NAMESTORE-FCFSD 1 "5 Sep 2013" "GNUnet"

.SH NAME
gnunet\-namestore-fcfsd \- HTTP server for GNU Name System First-Come-First-Served name registration

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-namestore-fcfsd
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
Most users will not want to run an FCFS\-zone and thus will not need
this program.

\fBgnunet\-gns-fcfsd\fP runs a web server where users can register
names to be mapped to their GNS zone.  Names are made available on a
First Come First Served basis (hence fcfs).  Registered names do not
expire.  The HTTP server is run on the port that is specified in the
configuration file in section "[fcfsd]" under the name "HTTPPORT".

It is possible to manage gnunet\-gns\-fcfsd using
gnunet\-(service\-arm) by starting the daemon using "gnunet\-arm \-i
fcfsd" or by setting "IMMEDIATE_START=YES" in the "fcfds" section of your
configuration and the "-z ZONE" in as the "OPTION".

An FCFS\-zone is run at http://gnunet.org/fcfs/.  GNS users are
encouraged to register their zone with the gnunet.org FCFS authority.

If you want to run your own FCFS registrar, you need to first create a
pseudonym (using "gnunet\-identity \-C NAME"), and use it with the
"-z" option.  After that, you can start the FCFSD service (possibly using
gnunet\-arm).
