.Sh NAME

HTTP server for GNU Name System First-Come-First-Served name registration
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl c Ar FILENAME | Fl -config= Ns Ar FILENAME
.Op Fl h | -help
.Op Fl L Ar LOGLEVEL | Fl -loglevel= Ns Ar LOGLEVEL
.Op Fl v | -version
.Op Fl z Ar EGO | -zone= Ns Ar EGO
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Most users will not want to run an FCFS-zone and thus will not need this program.
.Pp
.Nm
runs a web server where users can register names to be mapped to their GNS zone.
Names are made available on a First Come First Served basis (hence fcfs).
Registered names do not expire.
The HTTP server is run on the port that is specified in the configuration file in section "[fcfsd]" under the name "HTTPPORT".
.Pp
It is possible to manage gnunet-gns-fcfsd using gnunet-(service-arm) by starting the daemon using "gnunet-arm -i fcfsd" or by setting "IMMEDIATE_START=YES" in the "fcfds" section of your configuration and the "-z ZONE" in as the "OPTION".
.Pp
An FCFS-zone is run at
.Lk http://gnunet.org/fcfs/ .
GNS users are encouraged to register their zone with the gnunet.org FCFS authority.
.Pp
If you want to run your own FCFS registrar, you need to first create a pseudonym (using "gnunet-identity -C NAME"), and use it with the
.Fl z
option.
After that, you can start the FCFSD service (possibly using
.Xr gnunet-arm 1 Ns ).
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl c Ar FILENAME | Fl -config= Ns Ar FILENAME
Use the configuration file FILENAME.
.It Fl h | -help
Print short help on options.
.It Fl L Ar LOGLEVEL | Fl -loglevel= Ns Ar LOGLEVEL
Use LOGLEVEL for logging.
Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR.
.It Fl v | -version
Print GNUnet version number.
.It Fl z Ar EGO | -zone= Ns Ar EGO
Specifies for which
.Ar EGO
FCFSD should manage the zone.
