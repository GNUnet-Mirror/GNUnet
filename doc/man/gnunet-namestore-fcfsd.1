.SH NAME
gnunet\-namestore-fcfsd \- HTTP server for GNU Name System First-Come-First-Served name registration

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-namestore-fcfsd
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
Most users will not want to run an FCFS\-zone and thus will not need
this program.

\fBgnunet\-gns-fcfsd\fP runs a web server where users can register
names to be mapped to their GNS zone.  Names are made available on a
First Come First Served basis (hence fcfs).  Registered names do not
expire.  The HTTP server is run on the port that is specified in the
configuration file in section "[fcfsd]" under the name "HTTPPORT".
The key of the zone in which the names are registered must be
specified under the name "ZONEKEY" in the same section.  It is
possible to manage gnunet\-gns\-fcfsd using gnunet\-(service\-arm) by
starting the daemon using "gnunet\-arm \-i fcfsd" or by setting
"FORCESTART=YES" in the "fcfds" section of your configuration.

An FCFS\-zone is run at http://gnunet.org/fcfs/.  GNS users are
encouraged to register their zone with the gnunet.org FCFS authority.

If you want to run your own FCFS registrar, you need to first create a
pseudonym (using "gnunet\-identity \-C NAME"), and then assign it to
be used for the "fcfsd" service using "gnunet\-identity \-e NAME \-s
fcfsd".  After that, you can start the FCFSD service (possibly using
gnunet\-arm).
