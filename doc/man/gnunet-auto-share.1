.TH GNUNET\-AUTO\-SHARE "1" "18 Jun 2012" "GNUnet"
.SH NAME
gnunet\-auto\-share \- a command line tool to automatically share an entire directory with other users
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-auto\-share
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] DIRNAME
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
In order to share files with other GNUnet users, the files must first be made available to GNUnet.  This tool can be used to automatically share all files from a certain directory.  The program will periodically scan the directory for changes and publish files that are new or that changed on GNUnet.  Which files have already been shared is remembered in a ".auto-share" file in the shared directory.  You can run the tool by hand or automatically by adding the respective options to your configuration.  gnunet\-auto\-share has many options in common with gnunet\-publish, but can only be used to index files.
.PP
You can use automatic meta\-data extraction (based on libextractor).
.PP

\fB\-c \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config=FILENAME\fR
Use alternate config file (if this option is not specified, the default is ~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf).

.TP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-disable\-extractor\fR 
Disable use of GNU libextractor for finding additional keywords and metadata.

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a brief help page with all the options.

.TP
\fB\-L \fILOGLEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-loglevel=\fILOGLEVEL\fR
Change the loglevel.  Possible values for LOGLEVEL are 
ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG. 

.TP
\fB\-p \fIPRIORITY\fR, \fB\-\-prio=\fIPRIORITY\fR
Executive summary: You probably don't need it.

Set the priority of the published content (default: 365).  If the local database is full, GNUnet will discard the content with the lowest ranking.  Note that ranks change over time depending on popularity.  The default should be high enough to preserve the locally published content in favor of content that migrates from other peers.

.TP
\fB\-r \fILEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-replication=\fILEVEL\fR
Set the desired replication level.  If CONTENT_PUSHING is set to YES, GNUnet will push each block (for the file) LEVEL times to other peers before doing normal "random" replication of all content.  This option can be used to push some content out into the network harder. Note that pushing content LEVEL times into the network does not guarantee that there will actually be LEVEL replicas.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number.

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Be verbose.  Using this option causes gnunet\-publish to print progress information and at the end the file identification that can be used to download the file from GNUnet.


.SH SETTING ANONYMITY LEVEL

The \fB\-a\fR option can be used to specify additional anonymity constraints. If set to 0, GNUnet will publish the file non-anonymously and in fact sign the advertisement for the file using your peer's private key.  This will allow other users to download the file as fast as possible, including using non-anonymous methods (DHT, direct transfer).  If you set it to 1 (default), you use the standard anonymous routing algorithm (which does not explicitly leak your identity).  However, a powerful adversary may still be able to perform traffic analysis (statistics) to over time infer data about your identity.  You can gain better privacy by specifying a higher level of anonymity, which increases the amount of cover traffic your own traffic will get, at the expense of performance.  Note that regardless of the anonymity level you choose, peers that cache content in the network always use anonymity level 1.  

The definition of the ANONYMITY LEVEL is the following.  0 means no anonymity is required.  Otherwise a value of 'v' means that 1 out of v bytes of "anonymous" traffic can be from the local user, leaving 'v-1' bytes of cover traffic per byte on the wire.  Thus, if GNUnet routes n bytes of messages from foreign peers (using anonymous routing), it may originate n/(v-1) bytes of data in the same time\-period. The time\-period is twice the average delay that GNUnet defers forwarded queries. 

The default is 1 and this should be fine for most users.  Also notice that if you choose very large values, you may end up having no throughput at all, especially if many of your fellow GNUnet\-peers all do the same.
