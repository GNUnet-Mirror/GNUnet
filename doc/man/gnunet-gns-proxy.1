.Sh DESCRIPTION
Most users will want to run this SOCKS proxy.
It can be used in combination with browsers that support the SOCKS 4a protocol.
.Pp
The proxy will perform SSL authentication of GNS names and rewrite GNS enabled HTML content.
To assert the validity of GNS names a local root CA certificate has to be generated that is used by the proxy.
Thus "gnunet-gns-proxy-setup-ca" should be executed before the first launch of this proxy or the \-\-authority switch is used to specify an appropriate CA certificate that is already trusted by the browser.
