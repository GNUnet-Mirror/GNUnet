.SH NAME
gnunet\-nat \- interact with the NAT service

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-nat
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION

This tool allows testing various NAT traversal functions, as well
as attempting auto\-configuration.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-a,  \-\-auto"
Attempt auto\-configuration for NAT traversal.

.B
.IP "\-b ADDRESS,  \-\-bind=ADDRESS"
Assume that the service is (locally) bound to ADDRESS.

.B
.IP "\-c FILENAME,  \-\-config=FILENAME"
Use the configuration file FILENAME.

.B
.IP "\-e ADDRESS,  \-\-external=ADDRESS"
Assume that ADDRESS is the globally visible address of the peer.

.B
.IP "\-i ADDRESS,  \-\-in=ADDRESS"
Assuming we are listening at ADDRESS for connection reversal requests.

.B
.IP "\-r ADDRESS,  \-\-remote=ADDRESS"
Ask the peer at ADDRESS for connection reversal, using the local address for the target address of the reversal.

.B
.IP "\-p PORT,  \-\-port=PORT"
Use PORT as our external port for advertising for incoming requests.

.B
.IP "\-s,  \-\-stun"
Enable processing of STUN requests.  Will try to read UDP packets from the bind address and handle the packets if they are STUN packets. Will only work with UDP.

.B
.IP "\-t,  \-\-tcp"
Use TCP.

.B
.IP "\-u,  \-\-udp"
Use UDP.

.B
.IP "\-w,  \-\-write"
Write configuration to configuration file, useful in combination with autoconfiguration (\-a).

.B
.IP "\-W,  \-\-watch"
Watch for connection reversal requests.  

.SH EXAMPLES

\fBBasic examples\fR

We are bound to "0.0.0.0:8080" on UDP and want to obtain all applicable IP addresses (BUG: sometimes upnpc fails to create mapping, cause unclear):

  # gnunet-nat -i 0.0.0.0:8080 -u

We are bound to "::0" on port 8080 on TCP and want to obtain all applicable IP addresses:

  # gnunet-nat -i '[::0]':8080 -t

We are bound to "127.0.0.1:8080" on UDP and want to obtain all applicable IP addresses (BUG: currently fails, also gives IPs from other interfaces in output!):

  # gnunet-nat -i 127.0.0.1:8080 -u

\fBSTUN-based XXX:\fR

  # gnunet-nat FIXME -s

\fBAutomatic configuration:\fR

Probe and write result to configuration:

  # gnunet-nat -aw
