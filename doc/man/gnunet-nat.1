.Sh NAME
.Nm gnunet-nat
.Nd
interact with the NAT service
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl b Ar ADDRESS | Fl -bind= Ns Ar ADDRESS
.Op Fl c Ar FILENAME | Fl -config= Ns Ar FILENAME
.Op Fl e Ar ADDRESS | Fl -external= Ns Ar ADDRESS
.Op Fl i Ar ADDRESS | Fl -in= Ns Ar ADDRESS
.Op Fl r Ar ADDRESS | Fl -remote= Ns Ar ADDRESS
.Op Fl S Ar NAME | Fl -section= Ns Ar NAME
.Op Fl s | -stun
.Op Fl t | -tcp
.Op Fl u | -udp
.Op Fl W | -watch
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This tool allows testing various NAT traversal functions, as well as attempting auto-configuration.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Fl b Ar ADDRESS | Fl -bind= Ns Ar ADDRESS
Assume that the service is (locally) bound to ADDRESS.
.It Fl c Ar FILENAME | Fl -config= Ns Ar FILENAME
Use the configuration file FILENAME.
.It Fl e Ar ADDRESS | Fl -external= Ns Ar ADDRESS
Assume that ADDRESS is the globally visible address of the peer.
.It Fl i Ar ADDRESS | Fl -in= Ns Ar ADDRESS
Assuming we are listening at ADDRESS for connection reversal requests.
.It Fl r Ar ADDRESS | Fl -remote= Ns Ar ADDRESS
Ask the peer at ADDRESS for connection reversal, using the local address for the target address of the reversal.
.It Fl S Ar NAME | Fl -section= Ns Ar NAME
Name of section in configuration file to use for additional options.
.It Fl s | -stun
Enable processing of STUN requests.
Will try to read UDP packets from the bind address and handle the packets if they are STUN packets.
Will only work with UDP.
.It Fl t | -tcp
Use TCP.
.It Fl u | -udp
Use UDP.
.It Fl W | -watch
Watch for connection reversal requests.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Ss Basic examples
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -i 0.0.0.0:8080 -u
.Pp
We are bound to "0.0.0.0:8080" on UDP and want to obtain all applicable IP addresses.
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -i '[::0]':8080 -t
.Pp
We are bound to "::0" on port 8080 on TCP and want to obtain all applicable IP addresses.
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -i 127.0.0.1:8080 -u
.Pp
We are bound to "127.0.0.1:8080" on UDP and want to obtain all applicable IP addresses:
.Ss ICMP-based NAT traversal
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -Wt -i 192.168.178.12:8080
.Pp
Watch for connection reversal request (you must be bound to NAT range or to wildcard, 0.0.0.0), only works for IPv4:
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -t -r 1.2.3.4:8080 -i 2.3.4.5:8080
.Pp Initiate connection reversal request from peer at external IPv4 address 1.2.3.4, while we are running ourselves at 2.3.4.5:8080 (must use IPv4 addresses):
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -t -r 1.2.3.4:8080 -i 0.0.0.0:8080
.Pp
Initiate connection reversal request from peer at external IPv4 address 1.2.3.4, and let the kernel fill in whatever IPv4 address we happen to have:
.Ss Manual hole punching
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat -t -p AUTO:8080
.Pp
Assume manually punched NAT, but determine external IP automatically:
.Ss STUN-based XXX:
.Pp
.Dl # gnunet-nat FIXME -s
.Pp
