.TH GNUNET\-CADET 1 "May 3, 2016" "GNUnet"

.SH NAME
gnunet\-cadet \- Create or obtain information about CADET tunnels and peers

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-cadet
.RI [ options ]
.I [ \fIPEER_ID SHARED_SECRET\fR ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgnunet\-cadet\fP prints information about CADET tunnels and peers.
It can also be used for command-line based CADET tunnels using the
\fI-o SHARED_SECRET\fR option to open a port on a receiving PEER_ID
and using "\fBgnunet\-cadet\fP \fIPEER_ID SHARED_SECRET\fR" to
establish one circuit to that peer from any other peer. The receiving
process will only accept one incoming circuit, but several commands
using the same \fI-o\fR can be issued to satisfy multiple requests.
For one\-to\-many communication \fBgnunet\-social\fP may be better
suited, however.
