.SH NAME
gnunet\-dns2gns \- run a DNS-to-GNS proxy

.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
Most users will not want to run an DNS to GNS proxy/gateway and thus will not
need this program.

\fBgnunet\-dns2gns\fP runs a DNS resolver which delegates requests GNS if
the TLD matches one configured for GNS.  All other requests are forwarded
to DNS.  This DNS proxy is useful for enabling non-personalized
GNS\-resolution to an entire network or to offer GNS\-resolution to DNS users.
