.Sh DESCRIPTION
Search for content on GNUnet.
The keywords are case-sensitive.
.Nm
can be used both for a search in the global namespace as well as for searching a private subspace.

.It Fl a Ar LEVEL | Fl \-anonymity= Ns Ar LEVEL
The \fB\-a\fR option can be used to specify additional anonymity constraints.
If set to 0, GNUnet will try to download the file as fast as possible, including using non-anonymous methods.
If you set it to 1 (default), you use the standard anonymous routing algorithm (which does not explicitly leak your identity).
However, a powerful adversary may still be able to perform traffic analysis (statistics) to over time infer data about your identity.
You can gain better privacy by specifying a higher level of anonymity, which increases the amount of cover traffic your own traffic will get, at the expense of performance.
Note that your download performance is not only determined by your own anonymity level, but also by the anonymity level of the peers publishing the file.
So even if you download with anonymity level 0, the peers publishing the data might be sharing with a higher anonymity level, which in this case will determine performance.
Also, peers that cache content in the network always use anonymity level 1.
.sp
This option can be used to limit requests further than that.
In particular, you can require GNUnet to receive certain amounts of traffic from other peers before sending your queries.
This way, you can gain very high levels of anonymity \- at the expense of much more traffic and much higher latency.
So set it only if you really believe you need it.
.sp
The definition of ANONYMITY\-RECEIVE is the following.
0 means no anonymity is required.
Otherwise a value of 'v' means that 1 out of v bytes of "anonymous" traffic can be from the local user, leaving 'v-1' bytes of cover traffic per byte on the wire.
Thus, if GNUnet routes n bytes of messages from foreign peers (using anonymous routing), it may originate n/(v-1) bytes of queries in the same time\-period.
The time\-period is twice the average delay that GNUnet defers forwarded queries.
.sp
The default is 1 and this should be fine for most users.
Also notice that if you choose very large values, you may end up having no throughput at all, especially if many of your fellow GNUnet\-peers all do the same.
.It Fl c Ar FILENAME | Fl \-config= Ns Ar FILENAME
use config file (defaults: ~/.config/gnunet.conf)
.It Fl h | \-help
print help page
.It Fl L Ar LOGLEVEL | Fl \-loglevel= Ns Ar LOGLEVEL
Change the loglevel.
Possible values for LOGLEVEL are ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG.
.It Fl l Ar FILENAME | Fl \-logfile= Ns Ar FILENAME
Write logs to FILENAME.
.It Fl o Ar FILENAME | Fl \-output= Ns Ar FILENAME
Writes a GNUnet directory containing all of the search results to FILENAME.
.It Fl n | \-no-network
Only search locally, do not forward requests to other peers.
.It Fl N Ar VALUE | Fl \-results= Ns Ar VALUE
Automatically terminate the search after receiving VALUE results.
.It Fl t Ar DELAY | Fl \-timeout= Ns Ar DELAY
Automatically timeout search after DELAY.
The value given must be a number followed by a space and a time unit, for example "500 ms".
Note that the quotes are required on the shell.
Otherwise the search runs until gnunet\-search is aborted with CTRL\-C.
.It Fl v | \-version
print the version number
.It Fl V | \-verbose
print meta data from search results as well
.El
You can run gnunet\-search with an URI instead of a keyword.
The URI can have the format for a namespace search or for a keyword search.
For a namespace search, the format is
.Pp
.Dl gnunet://fs/sks/NAMESPACE/IDENTIFIER
.Pp
For a keyword search, use
.Pp
.Dl gnunet://fs/ksk/KEYWORD[+KEYWORD]*
.Pp
If the format does not correspond to a GNUnet URI, GNUnet will automatically assume that keywords are supplied directly.
.sp
If multiple keywords are passed, gnunet-search will look for content
matching any of the keywords.
The prefix "+" makes a keyword mandatory.
.Sh FILES
.Pa ~/.config/gnunet.conf
GNUnet configuration file; specifies the default value for the timeout
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl $ gnunet\-search "Das Kapital"
.Pp
Searches for content matching the keyword "Das Kapital".
.Pp
.Dl $ gnunet\-search +Das +Kapital
.Pp
Searches for content matching both mandatory keywords "Das" and "Kapital".
.sp
Search results are printed by gnunet\-search like this:
.Pp
.ad l
        gnunet\-download \-o "COPYING" gnunet://fs/chk/HASH1.HASH2.SIZE

                Description: The GNU General Public License

                Mime-type: text/plain
.ad b

The first line contains the command to run to download the file.
The suggested filename in the example is COPYING.
The GNUnet URI consists of the key and query hash of the file and finally the size of the file.
After the command to download the file GNUnet will print meta\-data about the file as advertised in the search result, here "The GNU General Public License" and the mime\-type (see the options for gnunet\-publish on how to supply meta-data by hand).

The full documentation for gnunet is maintained as a Texinfo manual.
If the
.Xr info 1
and gnunet programs are properly installed at your site, the command
.Pp
.Dl info gnunet
.Pp
should give you access to the complete handbook,
.Pp
.Dl info gnunet-c-tutorial
.Pp
will give you access to a tutorial for developers.

Depending on your installation, this information is also available in
