.TH GNUNET-SEARCH "1" "25 Feb 2012" "GNUnet"
.SH NAME
gnunet\-search \- a command line interface to search for content on GNUnet
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-search
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [+]\fIKEYWORD\fR [[+]\fIKEYWORD\fR]*

.B gnunet\-search
[\fIOPTIONS\fR] [+]\fIURI\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Search for content on GNUnet. The keywords are case\-sensitive.  gnunet\-search can be used both for a search in the global namespace as well as for searching a private subspace.
.TP
\fB\-a \fILEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-anonymity=\fILEVEL\fR

The \fB\-a\fR option can be used to specify additional anonymity constraints. If set to 0, GNUnet will try to download the file as fast as possible, including using non-anonymous methods.  If you set it to 1 (default), you use the standard anonymous routing algorithm (which does not explicitly leak your identity).  However, a powerful adversary may still be able to perform traffic analysis (statistics) to over time infer data about your identity.  You can gain better privacy by specifying a higher level of anonymity, which increases the amount of cover traffic your own traffic will get, at the expense of performance.  Note that your download performance is not only determined by your own anonymity level, but also by the anonymity level of the peers publishing the file.  So even if you download with anonymity level 0, the peers publishing the data might be sharing with a higher anonymity level, which in this case will determine performance.  Also, peers that cache content in the network always use anonymity level 1.  

This option can be used to limit requests further than that. In particular, you can require GNUnet to receive certain amounts of traffic from other peers before sending your queries. This way, you can gain very high levels of anonymity \- at the expense of much more traffic and much higher latency. So set it only if you really believe you need it.

The definition of ANONYMITY\-RECEIVE is the following.  0 means no anonymity is required.  Otherwise a value of 'v' means that 1 out of v bytes of "anonymous" traffic can be from the local user, leaving 'v-1' bytes of cover traffic per byte on the wire.  Thus, if GNUnet routes n bytes of messages from foreign peers (using anonymous routing), it may originate n/(v-1) bytes of queries in the same time\-period. The time\-period is twice the average delay that GNUnet defers forwarded queries. 

The default is 1 and this should be fine for most users.  Also notice that if you choose very large values, you may end up having no throughput at all, especially if many of your fellow GNUnet\-peers all do the same.

.TP
\fB\-c \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config=\fIFILENAME\fR
use config file (defaults: ~/.gnunet/gnunet.conf)

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
print help page

.TP
\fB\-L \fILOGLEVEL\fR, \fB\-\-loglevel=\fILOGLEVEL\fR
Change the loglevel.  Possible values for LOGLEVEL are 
ERROR, WARNING, INFO and DEBUG. 

.TP
\fB\-o \fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-output=\fIFILENAME\fR
Writes a GNUnet directory containing all of the search results to FILENAME.

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-no-network\fR
Only search locally, do not forward requests to other peers.

.TP
\fB\-N \fIVALUE\fR, \fB\-\-results=\fIVALUE\fR
automatically terminate the search after receiving VALUE results.

.TP
\fB\-t \fIVALUE\fR, \fB\-\-timeout=\fIVALUE\fR
Automatically timeout search after VALUE ms.  Otherwise the search runs until gnunet\-search is aborted with CTRL\-C.

.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
print the version number

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
print meta data from search results as well
.SH NOTES

You can run gnunet\-search with an URI instead of a keyword.  The URI can have the format for a namespace search or for a keyword search.  For a namespace search, the format is gnunet://fs/sks/NAMESPACE/IDENTIFIER.  For a keyword search, use gnunet://fs/ksk/KEYWORD[+KEYWORD]*.  If the format does not correspond to a GNUnet URI, GNUnet will automatically assume that keywords are supplied directly.  

If multiple keywords are passed, gnunet-search will look for content matching any of the keywords.  The prefix "+" makes a keyword mandatory.  

# gnunet\-search "Das Kapital"

searches for content matching the keyword "Das Kapital".  Whereas

# gnunet\-search +Das +Kapital

Searches for content matching both mandatory keywords "Das" and "Kapital".

Search results are printed by gnunet\-search like this:
.P
.ad l
	gnunet\-download \-o "COPYING" gnunet://fs/chk/HASH1.HASH2.SIZE

		Description: The GNU General Public License

		Mime-type: text/plain
.ad b

The first line contains the command to run to download the file.  The suggested filename in the example is COPYING.  The GNUnet URI consists of the key and query hash of the file and finally the size of the file.  After the command to download the file GNUnet will print meta\-data about the file as advertised in the search result, here "The GNU General Public License" and the mime\-type (see the options for gnunet\-publish on how to supply meta-data by hand).
