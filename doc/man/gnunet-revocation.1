.TH GNUNET\-REVOCATION 1 "March 15, 2012" "GNUnet"

.SH NAME
gnunet\-revocation \- revoke private keys (of egos) in GNUnet

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-revocation
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgnunet\-revocation\fP can be used to verify if a key has been
revoked, to create a revocation certificate for later revocation, to
instantly revoke a key and to use a pre-generated revocation
certificate to revoke a key.  Upon successful revocation, all peers
will be informed about the invalidity of the key.  As this is an
expensive operation, GNUnet requires the issuer of the revocation to
perform an expensive proof-of-work computation before they will be
allowed to perform the revocation.  gnunet\-revocation will perform
this computation.  The computation can be performed ahead of time,
with the resulting revocation certificate being stored in a file for
later "instant" use.  gnunet\-revocation also makes is possible to
resume the pre-calculation of a revocation --- simply abort a running
proof-of-work calculation with CTRL-C, and the existing revocation
certificate file will contain the status of the computation.  Note
that performing a revocation proof-of-work is deliberately VERY
expensive.  Depending on your CPU, the calculation can take days or
weeks.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-t KEY, \-\-test=KEY"
Check if the given KEY (ASCII\-encoded public key required) has been
revoked.
.B
.IP "\-R NAME, \-\-revoke=NAME"
Calculate or perform revocation for the ego with the given NAME.
.B
.IP "\-p, \-\-perform"
Actually perform the revocation as soon as possible (do not just
generate a revocation certificate, use it).  Must be supplied to
actually perform the revocation.
.B
.IP "\-f NAME, \-\-filename=NAME"
Use NAME as the name of the file that is to contain the revocation
certificate.  Intermediate computation results will be stored here, as
well as the final revocation certificate.  When used together with
\-p, this file will be inspected to see if it contains a valid
certificate for instant revocation, in which case the revocation can
be performed instantly.  If the given file contains anything (a valid
certificate, with or without the completed proof-of-work) there is no
need to supply the "\-R" option or to still have the private key of
the ego to perform the revocation.
.B
.IP "\-c FILENAME,  \-\-config=FILENAME"
Use the configuration file FILENAME.
.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Print short help on options.
.B
.IP "\-L LOGLEVEL, \-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL"
Use LOGLEVEL for logging.  Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and
ERROR.
.B
.IP "\-v, \-\-version"
Print GNUnet version number.
