.TH GNUNET\-REVOCATION 1 "Mar 15, 2012" "GNUnet"

.SH NAME
gnunet\-revocation \- revoke private keys (of egos) in GNUnet

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gnunet\-revocation
.RI [ options ]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBgnunet\-revocation\fP can be used to verify if a key has been revoked, to create a revocation certificate for later revocation, to instantly revoke a key and to use a pre-generated revocation certificate to revoke a key.  Upon successful revocation, all peers will be informed about the invalidity of the key.  As this is an expensive operation, GNUnet requires the issuer of the revocation to perform an expensive proof-of-work computation before he will be allowed to perform the revocation.  gnunet\-revocation will perform this computation.  The computation can be performed ahead of time, with the resulting revocation certificate being stored in a file for later "instant" use.  gnunet\-revocation also makes is possible to resume the pre-calculation of a revocation --- simply abort a running proof-of-work calculation with CTRL-C, and the existing revocation certificate file will contain the status of the computation.  Note that performing a revocation proof-of-work is deliberately VERY expensive.  Depending on your CPU, the calculation can take days or weeks.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.IP "\-t KEY, \-\-test=KEY"
Check if the given KEY (ASCII\-encoded public key required) has been revoked.
.B
.IP "\-R NAME, \-\-revoke=NAME"
Calculate or perform revocation for the ego with the given NAME.
.B
.IP "\-p, \-\-perform"
Actually perform the revocation as soon as possible (do not just generate a revocation certificate, use it).  Must be supplied to actually perform the revocation.
.B
.IP "\-f NAME, \-\-filename=NAME"
Use NAME as the name of the file that is to contain the revocation certificate.  Intermediate computation results will be stored here, as well as the final revocation certificate.  When used together with \-p, this file will be inspected to see if it contains a valid certificate for instant revocation, in which case the revocation can be performed instantly.  If the given file contains anything (a valid certificate, with or without the completed proof-of-work) there is no need to supply the "\-R" option or to still have the private key of the ego to perform the revocation.
.B
.IP "\-c FILENAME,  \-\-config=FILENAME"
Use the configuration file FILENAME.
.B
.IP "\-h, \-\-help"
Print short help on options.
.B
.IP "\-L LOGLEVEL, \-\-loglevel=LOGLEVEL"
Use LOGLEVEL for logging.  Valid values are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING and ERROR.
.B
.IP "\-v, \-\-version"
Print GNUnet version number.
