All documentation should be put under FSF approved licenses
(see @uref{https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html, fdl}).

By submitting documentation, translations, and other content to GNUnet
you automatically grant the right to publish code under the
GNU Public License and documentation under either or both the

@cindex copyright assignment
@node Copyright Assignment
@section Copyright Assignment
We require a formal copyright assignment for GNUnet contributors
to GNUnet e.V.; nevertheless, we do allow pseudonymous contributions.
By signing the copyright agreement and submitting your code (or
documentation) to us, you agree to share the rights to your code
with GNUnet e.V.; GNUnet e.V. receives non-exclusive ownership
rights, and in particular is allowed to dual-license the code. You
retain non-exclusive rights to your contributions, so you can also
share your contributions freely with other projects.

GNUnet e.V. will publish all accepted contributions under the GPLv3
or any later version. The association may decide to publish
contributions under additional licenses (dual-licensing).

We do not intentionally remove your name from your contributions;
however, due to extensive editing it is not always trivial to
attribute contributors properly. If you find that you significantly
contributed to a file (or the project as a whole) and are not listed
in the respective authors file or section, please do let us know.

@section Contributing to the Reference Manual

@itemize @bullet

@item When writing documentation, please use
@uref{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_they, gender-neutral wording}
when referring to people, such as singular “they”, “their”, “them”, and so
forth.

@item Keep line length below 74 characters, except for URLs.
URLs break in the PDF output when they contain linebreaks.

@item Do not use tab characters (see chapter 2.1 texinfo manual)

@item Use neutral language and third person perspective in the text

@item So, when you refer to a user in general or addressing the user,
refer to (1).
@itemize @bullet
@item Unsolved exceptions for canonical reasons: When refering to Alice,
use "she". When refering to Bob, use "he". These are long established
examples and they should either be replaced (avoid Alice and Bob
examples when you can) or followed.
@end itemize

@item Use 2 spaces between sentences, so instead of:

@example
We do this and the other thing. This is done by foo.
@end example

Write:

@example
We do this and the other thing.  This is done by foo.
@end example

@item Use @@footnote@{@} instead of putting an @@*ref@{@} to the
footnote on a collected footnote-page.
In a 200+ pages handbook it's better to have footnotes accessible
without having to skip over to the end.

@item Avoid unnecessary footnotes, keep the text self-explanatory and
in a simple language where possible/necessary.

@end itemize
