How to setup the Postgres database for GNUnet.

NOTE: This db module was developed for Postgres 8.3.  I have no
idea what the minimum version that we require is exactly.

HIGHLIGHTS

Pros
 + Easier to setup than MySQL
 + Real database
Cons 
 - Quite slow
 - Still some setup

MANUAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

 1) in /etc/gnunet.conf, set
    sqstore = "sqstore_postgres"

 2) Then access postgres to create a user; I had to do this to get 
    access and create a user:
    # su - postgres
    $ createuser
    At this point, use the name of the user running gnunet
    for the role, do not set it to superuser, allow the creation
    of databases.

 3) As that user, create a database (or two):
    $ createdb gnunet
    $ createdb gnunetcheck # this way you can run "make check"

 Thats it. 

 4) Still, perhaps you should briefly try if the DB connection 
    works. First, login as the user who will run gnunetd. Then use,

    $ psql gnunet # or gnunetcheck
    gnunet=> \dt
   
    If, after you have started gnunetd at least once, you get a
    gn090 table here, it probably works.
 
PROBLEMS?

If you have problems related to the postgres module, your best friend
is probably the postgres manual. The first thing to check is that
postgres is basically operational, that you can connect to it, create
tables, issue queries etc. (see step 4 above for details).
