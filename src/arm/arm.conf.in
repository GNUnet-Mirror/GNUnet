# If set to YES, ARM will only start services that are marked as

# If set to YES, ARM will only start services that are marked as

# better personalization and  priviledge separation and in particular
# ensures that personal data is stored under $HOME, which might
# be important in a multi-user system (or if $HOME is encrypted
# and /var/ is not).
