The aim of the stream library is to provide stream connections between peers in
GNUnet. This is a convenience library which hides the complexity of dividing
data stream into packets, transmitting them and retransmitting them in case of
errors.

This library's API are similar to unix PIPE API. The user is expected to open a
stream to a listening target peer. Once the stream is established, the user can
use it as a pipe. Any data written into the stream will be readable by the
target peer.

This library uses mesh API for establishing streams between peers.
