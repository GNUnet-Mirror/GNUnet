 * Identity management.
 *
 * Egos in GNUnet are ECDSA keys.  You assume an ego by using (signing
 * with) a particular private key.  As GNUnet users are expected to
 * have many egos, we need an identity service to allow users to
 * manage their egos.  The identity service manages the egos (private
 * keys) of the local user; it does NOT manage egos of other users
 * (public keys).  For giving names to other users and manage their
 * public keys securely, we use GNS.

 * Method called to inform about the egos of this peer.

 * When used with #GNUNET_IDENTITY_connect, this function is
 * initially called for all egos and then again whenever a
 * ego's name changes or if it is deleted.  At the end of
 * the initial pass over all egos, the function is once called
 * with 'NULL' for @a ego. That does NOT mean that the callback won't
 * be invoked in the future or that there was an error.
 *
 * When used with #GNUNET_IDENTITY_create or #GNUNET_IDENTITY_get,
 * this function is only called ONCE, and 'NULL' being passed in
 * @a ego does indicate an error (i.e. name is taken or no default
 * value is known).  If @a ego is non-NULL and if '*ctx'
 * is set in those callbacks, the value WILL be passed to a subsequent
 * call to the identity callback of #GNUNET_IDENTITY_connect (if
 * that one was not NULL).
 *
 * When an identity is renamed, this function is called with the
 * (known) @a ego but the NEW @a name.
 *
 * When an identity is deleted, this function is called with the
 * (known) ego and "NULL" for the @a name.  In this case,
 * the @a ego is henceforth invalid (and the @a ctx should also be
 * cleaned up).
