 * @file include/gnunet_testing_lib-new.h
 * @brief convenience API for writing testcases for GNUnet;
 *        can start/stop one or more peers on a system;
 *        testing is responsible for managing private keys,
 *        ports and paths; it is a low-level library that
 *        does not support higher-level functions such as
 *        P2P connection, topology management or distributed
 *        testbed maintenance (those are in gnunet_testbed_service.h)
