/** 
 * @file include/gnunet_psyc_service.h
 * @brief PSYC service; high-level access to the PSYC protocol
 *        note that clients of this API are NOT expected to
 *        understand the PSYC message format, only the semantics!
 *        Parsing (and serializing) the PSYC stream format is done
 *        within the implementation of the libgnunetpsyc library,
 *        and this API deliberately exposes as little as possible
 *        of the actual data stream format to the application!
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * NOTE:
 * - this API does not know about psyc's "root" and "places";
 *   there is no 'root' in GNUnet-Psyc as we're decentralized;
 *   'places' and 'persons' are combined within the same 
 *   abstraction, that of a "channel".  Channels are identified
 *   and accessed in this API using a public/private key.  
 *   Higher-level applications should use NAMES within GADS
 *   to obtain public keys, and the distinction between 
 *   'places' and 'persons' can then be made with the help
 *   of the naming system (and/or conventions).
 *   Channels are (as in PSYC) organized into a hierarchy; each
 *   channel owner (the one with the private key) is then
 *   the operator of the multicast group (its Origin in 
 *   the terminology of the multicast API).
 * - The API supports passing large amounts of data using
 *   'streaming' for the argument passed to a method.  State
 *   and variables must fit into memory and cannot be streamed
 *   (thus, no passing of 4 GB of data in a variable; 
 *   once we implement this, we might want to create a
 *   @c \#define for the maximum size of a variable).
 * - PSYC defines standard variables, methods, etc.  This
 *   library deliberately abstracts over all of these; a
 *   higher-level API should combine the naming system (GADS)
 *   and standard methods (message, join, leave, warn,
 *   fail, error) and variables (action, color, time,
 *   tag, etc.).  However, this API does take over the
 *   routing variables, specifically 'context' (channel),
 *   and 'source'.  We only kind-of support 'target', as
 *   the target is either everyone in the group or the
 *   origin, and never just a single member of the group;
 *   for such individual messages, an application needs to
 *   construct an 'inbox' channel where the owner (only)
 *   receives messages (but never forwards; private responses
 *   would be transmitted by joining the senders 'inbox'
 *   channel -- or a inbox#bob subchannel).  The
 *   goal for all of this is to keep the abstractions in this 
 *   API minimal: interaction with multicast, try \& slice,
 *   state/variable/channel management.  Higher-level
 *   operations belong elsewhere (so maybe this API should
 *   be called 'PSYC-low', whereas a higher-level API
 *   implementing defaults for standard methods and
 *   variables might be called 'PSYC-std' or 'PSYC-high'.
