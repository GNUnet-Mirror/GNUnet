/**
 * Convenience method for running a "simple" test on the local system
 * with a single call from 'main'.  Underlay and overlay topology are
 * configured using the "UNDERLAY" and "OVERLAY" options in the
 * "[testbed]" section of the configuration (with possible options
 * given in "UNDERLAY_XXX" and/or "OVERLAY_XXX").
 *
 * The test is to be terminated using a call to
 * "GNUNET_SCHEDULER_shutdown".  If starting the test fails,
 * the program is stopped without 'master' ever being run.
 *
 * NOTE: this function should be called from 'main', NOT from
 * within a GNUNET_SCHEDULER-loop.  This function will initialze
 * the scheduler loop, the testbed and then pass control to
 * 'master'.
 *
 * @param testname name of the testcase (to configure logging, etc.)
 * @param cfg_filename configuration filename to use
 *              (for testbed, controller and peers)
 * @param num_peers number of peers to start
 * @param test_master task to run once the test is ready
 * @param test_master_cls closure for 'task'.
