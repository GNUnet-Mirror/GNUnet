 * Connect to a service offered by the given peer.  Will ensure that
 * the request is queued to not overwhelm our ability to create and
 * maintain connections with other systems.  The actual service
 * handle is then returned via the 'op_result' member in the event
 * callback.  The 'ca' callback is used to create the connection
 * when the time is right; the 'da' callback will be used to 
 * destroy the connection (upon 'GNUNET_TESTBED_operation_done').
 * 'GNUNET_TESTBED_operation_cancel' can be used to abort this
 * operation until the event callback has been called.
 *

 * @param peer peer that runs the service
 * @param service_name name of the service to connect to
 * @param ca helper function to establish the connection
 * @param da helper function to close the connection
