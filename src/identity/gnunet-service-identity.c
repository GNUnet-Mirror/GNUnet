 * @brief network size estimation service
 * @author Nathan Evans
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * The purpose of this service is to estimate the size of the network.
 * Given a specified interval, each peer hashes the most recent
 * timestamp which is evenly divisible by that interval.  This hash is
 * compared in distance to the peer identity to choose an offset.  The
 * closer the peer identity to the hashed timestamp, the earlier the
 * peer sends out a "nearest peer" message.  The closest peer's
 * message should thus be received before any others, which stops
 * those peer from sending their messages at a later duration.  So
 * every peer should receive the same nearest peer message, and from
 * this can calculate the expected number of peers in the network.
