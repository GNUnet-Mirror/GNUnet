/**
 * Possible state of a neighbour.  Initially, we are S_NOT_CONNECTED.
 *
 * Then, there are two main paths. If we receive a CONNECT message, we
 * first run a check against the blacklist (S_CONNECT_RECV_BLACKLIST_INBOUND).
 * If this check is successful, we give the inbound address to ATS.
 * After the check we ask ATS for a suggestion (S_CONNECT_RECV_ATS).
 * If ATS makes a suggestion, we ALSO give that suggestion to the blacklist
 * (S_CONNECT_RECV_BLACKLIST).  Once the blacklist approves the
 * address we got from ATS, we send our CONNECT_ACK and go to
 * S_CONNECT_RECV_ACK.  If we receive a SESSION_ACK, we go to
 * S_CONNECTED (and notify everyone about the new connection).  If the
 * operation times out, we go to S_DISCONNECT.
 *
 * The other case is where we transmit a CONNECT message first.  We
 * start with S_INIT_ATS.  If we get an address, we enter
 * S_INIT_BLACKLIST and check the blacklist.  If the blacklist is OK
 * with the connection, we actually send the CONNECT message and go to
 * state S_CONNECT_SENT.  Once we receive a CONNECT_ACK, we go to
 * S_CONNECTED (and notify everyone about the new connection and send
 * back a SESSION_ACK).  If the operation times out, we go to
 * S_DISCONNECT.
 *
 * If the session is in trouble (i.e. transport-level disconnect or
 * timeout), we go to S_RECONNECT_ATS where we ask ATS for a new
 * address (we don't notify anyone about the disconnect yet).  Once we
 * have a new address, we go to S_RECONNECT_BLACKLIST to check the new
 * address against the blacklist.  If the blacklist approves, we enter
 * S_RECONNECT_SENT and send a CONNECT message.  If we receive a
 * CONNECT_ACK, we go to S_CONNECTED and nobody noticed that we had
 * trouble; we also send a SESSION_ACK at this time just in case.  If
 * the operation times out, we go to S_DISCONNECT (and notify everyone
 * about the lost connection).
 *
 * If ATS decides to switch addresses while we have a normal
 * connection, we go to S_CONNECTED_SWITCHING_BLACKLIST to check the
 * new address against the blacklist.  If the blacklist approves, we
 * go to S_CONNECTED_SWITCHING_CONNECT_SENT and send a
 * SESSION_CONNECT.  If we get a SESSION_ACK back, we switch the
 * primary connection to the suggested alternative from ATS, go back
 * to S_CONNECTED and send a SESSION_ACK to the other peer just to be
 * sure.  If the operation times out (or the blacklist disapproves),
 * we go to S_CONNECTED (and notify ATS that the given alternative
 * address is "invalid").
 *
 * Once a session is in S_DISCONNECT, it is cleaned up and then goes
 * to (S_DISCONNECT_FINISHED).  If we receive an explicit disconnect
 * request, we can go from any state to S_DISCONNECT, possibly after
 * generating disconnect notifications.
 *
 * Note that it is quite possible that while we are in any of these
 * states, we could receive a 'CONNECT' request from the other peer.
 * We then enter a 'weird' state where we pursue our own primary state
 * machine (as described above), but with the 'send_connect_ack' flag
 * set to 1.  If our state machine allows us to send a 'CONNECT_ACK'
 * (because we have an acceptable address), we send the 'CONNECT_ACK'
 * and set the 'send_connect_ack' to 2.  If we then receive a
 * 'SESSION_ACK', we go to 'S_CONNECTED' (and reset 'send_connect_ack'
 * to 0).
