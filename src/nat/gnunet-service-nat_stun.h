/**
 * This code provides some support for doing STUN transactions.  We
 * receive the simplest possible packet as the STUN server and try
 * to respond properly.
 *
 * All STUN packets start with a simple header made of a type,
 * length (excluding the header) and a 16-byte random transaction id.
 * Following the header we may have zero or more attributes, each
 * structured as a type, length and a value (whose format depends
 * on the type, but often contains addresses).
 * Of course all fields are in network format.
 *
 * This code was based on ministun.c.
