/**
 * This code is based on ministun.c, that is based on Asterisk old STUN code.
 * This code provides some support for doing STUN transactions.
 * The simplest request packet is just the header defined in
 * struct stun_header, and from the response we may just look at
 * one attribute, STUN_MAPPED_ADDRESS, that we find in the response.
 * By doing more transactions with different server addresses we
 * may determine more about the behaviour of the NAT boxes, of
 * course - the details are in the RFC.
 *
 * All STUN packets start with a simple header made of a type,
 * length (excluding the header) and a 16-byte random transaction id.
 * Following the header we may have zero or more attributes, each
 * structured as a type, length and a value (whose format depends
 * on the type, but often contains addresses).
 * Of course all fields are in network format.
