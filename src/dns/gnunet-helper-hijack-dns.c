/**
 * @file dns/gnunet-helper-hijack-dns.c
 * @brief helper to install firewall rules to hijack all DNS traffic
 *        and send it to our virtual interface except for DNS traffic
 *        that originates on the specified port. 
 * @author Philipp TÃ¶lke
 * @author Christian Grothoff
 *
 * This program alters the Linux firewall rules so that DNS traffic
 * that ordinarily exits the system can be intercepted and managed by
 * a virtual interface.  In order to achieve this, DNS traffic is
 * marked with the DNS_MARK given in below and re-routed to a custom
 * table with the DNS_TABLE ID given below.  Systems and
 * administrators must take care to not cause conflicts with these
 * values (it was deemed safest to hardcode them as passing these
 * values as arguments might permit messing with arbitrary firewall
 * rules, which would be dangerous).
 *
 * Note that having this binary SUID is only partially safe: it will
 * allow redirecting (and intercepting / mangling) of all DNS traffic
 * originating from this system by any user who can create a virtual
 * interface (and this is again enabled by other GNUnet SUID
 * binaries).  Furthermore, even without the ability to create a
 * tunnel interface, this code will make it possible to DoS all DNS
 * traffic originating from the current system, simply by sending it
 * to nowhere.  
 *
 * Naturally, neither of these problems can be helped as this is the
 * fundamental purpose of the binary.  Certifying that this code is
 * "safe" thus only means that it doesn't allow anything else (such
 * as local priv. escalation, etc.). 
 *
 * The following list of people have reviewed this code and considered
 * it safe (within specifications) since the last modification (if you
 * reviewed it, please have your name added to the list):
 *
 * - Christian Grothoff
