   * stronger hash function due to the unconventional demand from the hash function in the extraction
   * setting. Second, as shown in Section 6, using HMAC with a truncated output as an extractor
   * allows to prove the security of HKDF under considerably weaker assumptions on the underlying
   * hash function."
